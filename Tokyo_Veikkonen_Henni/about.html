         <p>In November, Tokyo is covered in beatiful shades of red and yellow foliage. Tokyoâ€™s parks and gardens are a great way to enjoy the beatiful leaves. Take a stroll by the reflective ponds at Rikugien Gardens or have a picnic at the Koishikawa Botanical Garden.

         <p>During the Spring time the whole city turns pink when the sakura, the cherryblossoms, bloom. This time is very short so it is traditionally cherished by having a picnic and flowe-viewing. A great place to enjoy the flowers is the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden,Yoyogi and Inokashira parks.

         <p>The Summer in Tokyo is very hot and huid but there are less tourist and so it is a great time visit and experience the city like a local. Enjoy the many traditional festivals and fireworks, hit the beach, try shaved ice or if it gets to hot enjoy museums or the shopping centers.
